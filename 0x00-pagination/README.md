# 0x00. Pagination

This project is part of the `alx-backend` repository. The focus is on understanding and implementing pagination techniques to efficiently serve data from a backend, with different approaches to accommodate data size, deletion resilience, and hypermedia requirements.

## Project Overview

In this project, we dive into pagination as it is crucial for handling large datasets in APIs efficiently. This module covers:
- Basic pagination with page and page size parameters
- Pagination with hypermedia metadata to navigate between pages
- Techniques to make pagination deletion-resilient, ensuring that indexes remain consistent even if data is removed between requests.

## Project Setup

This project uses the file `Popular_Baby_Names.csv`, which contains a dataset of popular baby names. This data will be used for testing pagination across various tasks.

## Tasks

### 0. Simple Helper Function

**File**: `0-simple_helper_function.py`

**Objective**: Create a helper function, `index_range`, which takes two arguments, `page` and `page_size`, and returns a tuple indicating the start and end indexes for pagination. The page index is 1-based.

### 1. Simple Pagination

**File**: `1-simple_pagination.py`

**Objective**: Create a `Server` class with:
  - A method `get_page` that returns a specific page of the dataset, using page and page_size.
  - Validation for page and page_size, ensuring they are positive integers.
  - Use `index_range` to determine the indexes for the data slice.

### 2. Hypermedia Pagination

**File**: `2-hypermedia_pagination.py`

**Objective**: Enhance the `Server` class with a `get_hyper` method that:
  - Returns a dictionary with keys `page_size`, `page`, `data`, `next_page`, `prev_page`, and `total_pages`.
  - Calculates the total number of pages and includes navigation details (next and previous pages) to facilitate API traversal.

### 3. Deletion-resilient Hypermedia Pagination

**File**: `3-hypermedia_del_pagination.py`

**Objective**: Implement `get_hyper_index` in the `Server` class to manage pagination in a deletion-resilient way by:
  - Returning a dictionary with `index`, `next_index`, `page_size`, and `data`.
  - Ensuring that paginated results are unaffected by missing rows from previous requests.

## Requirements

- **Environment**: Python 3.7 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
- **Coding Standards**: Adhere to PEP 8 (pycodestyle).
- **Documentation**: Provide docstrings for all modules and functions.
